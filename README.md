# Project Liane  

Third person shooter developed with Unreal Engine 4 in C++ and blueprints

This build features enemy a.i., written in c++, that will run to cover if it is low on health or ammo, while attacking, and will search for the nearst health or ammo pack present in its path of retreat. 

The drone a.i., written in Unreal blueprints, will patrol along a set route of way points and contains logic of alerting nearby allies within it's radius if a player overlaps with the drone's spotlight.

Logic for enemies to shoot enviroment hazards (i.e. explosive barrels) that are closest to the player within their line of sight , written in blueprints, is a work in progress.
