 * A custom EQS generator that creates point in a cone-like fashion everywhere except in front of the bot
 * This generator (in addition with a few in-editor tests) is used to perform a sidestep functionality
 * while the bots are shooting at the player.
 * Place an EQS testing pawn in the level and assign this generator to its EQS template to showcase the resulting points
